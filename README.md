## **Prerequisite(s)**

* React
    - Popular JavaScript Library for building Frontend UIs
* Context API + Custom Hooks
    -   Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application.
* TypeScript
    - An open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world's most used tools, by adding static type definitions.
* IndexedDB Browser
    - low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data)

## **Skills to be learned**

* React
* ContextAPI
* Hooks
* IndexedDB
* Typescript

## **Focus** 

Web-based Personalized Tracker for 450 DSA curated questions by babbar


## **Objective** 

Data Structures and Algorithms are used to test the analytical skills of the candidates as they are a useful tool to pick out the underlying algorithms in real-world problems and solve them efficiently.


## Project Context 

Data structure is a process through which data is stored and arranged in the disk space of the computer or memory storage, in a way that the data can be easily used and manipulated in the future. It is an effective way of performing various operations related to data management.
<br>

With a sufficient understanding of data structure data can be organized and stored in a proper manner. Data structures are designed to organize data in order to suit specific purposes so as to access and perform operations in an appropriate manner.
<br>

You will this project with React using Typescript. I learned to react for a few months and very much influenced, yet simple project using Context and reducer, and use Browser realtime IndexDB, that means the app does not have a physical database, it caches.
